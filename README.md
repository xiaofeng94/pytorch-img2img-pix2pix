This repo is for my trail on image to depth.
For original repo see https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

Due to a poor performance of GAN for depth estimation, this repo is not maintained.

You may move to another repo for depth estimation from monocular images, [MSCN_NS](https://github.com/xiaofeng94/MSCNNS-for-monocular-depth-estimation).
